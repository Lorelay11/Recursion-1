We have a number of bunnies and each bunny has two big floppy ears. We want to compute the total number of ears across all the bunnies recursively (without loops or multiplication).


bunnyEars(0) → 0
bunnyEars(1) → 2
bunnyEars(2) → 4


public int bunnyEars(int bunnies) {
if (bunnies == 0){ 
return 0;}
else{
return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1);
}
}

explanation 

basically you're calling a function that calls itself with a lower argument. Walk it through with, say, 5 bunnies..

bunnyEars(5) = 2 + bunnyEars(4)

= 2 + 2 + bunnyEars(3)

= 2 + 2 + 2 + bunnyEars(2)

= 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + bunnyEars(1)

= 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + bunnyEars(0) // This is the special if case)

= 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0

= 10
