We have triangle made of blocks. The topmost row has 1 block, the next row down has 2 blocks, the next row has 3 blocks, and so on. Compute recursively (no loops or multiplication) the total number of blocks in such a triangle with the given number of rows.


triangle(0) → 0
triangle(1) → 1
triangle(2) → 3


my solution 
public int triangle(int rows) {
  int sum = rows;
  int i = 1;
  if(rows==0){
    return 0;
  }
  if(rows==1){
    return 1;
  }
  else{
    while(rows-i!=0){
      sum = sum + (rows-i);
      i++;
    }
    return sum;
  }
}

public int triangle(int rows) {

  if (rows == 0) return 0;

  return rows + triangle(rows-1);

}
